Mini Challenge 3 - Endpoints 5-7 (MadLib, OddOrEven & Reverse it)
Starting a new mini challenge where we are revisiting C# to design an API endpoint that receives user input and outputs a personalized message, number or reverse a number using an API Controller.
Person who Peer Reviewed me was Tony.
Comment:Everything looks good, and working perfectly. Very well done and nicely organized code! Good Work!
